# load_tester

This is an simple aggregator/automation tool to facilitate load testing on API endpoints.

Its main features include:
- generator for random dummy urls and request bodies with different payload size to better simulate real life traffic and measure longest path rather than constantly hitting a cached path somewhere
- invoke `wrk` with randomized data to help roughly estimate the max throughput of the endpoint
- invoke `wrk2` and `vegeta` with randomized data to determine the behaviour of and endpoint under a constant load (away from saturation point) to figure out a optimal load with latency meeting pre-specified requirements

To see all the available options, simply run
```
$ load_tester
```
